Note: this project is a fork of sumatrapdf project on github. I modified the reader to suit my reading needs. I forked this project on Febuary 15th. 

I have made the following changes in diversion to the original projects:
* Revert smart alt+tab menu control. It now just the familiar alt+tab
* Make scrolling on touchpad sample the events at 60 fps instead of 5 fps like the orginal
* Change background color (hardcoded)
* Control+numbers are now shortcuts to change tabs. Previously it was for zoooming commands. Zooming commands are instead using alt+number shortcuts
* Reduce horizonal scroll sensitivity (hardcoded)
